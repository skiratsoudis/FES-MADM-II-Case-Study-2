# FES-MADM-II — Case Study 2

This repository provides the replication package and computational artifacts for **Case Study 2** of the  
**FES-MADM II (Fuzzy Entropy–Synergy Multi-Attribute Decision-Making)** framework.

The case study corresponds to the article:

**“Shock-aware supplier portfolio selection using open contracting data:  
An auditable fuzzy entropy–synergy decision-analytics framework (FES-MADM II)”**

## Scope of this repository

This repository is **not** the core FES-MADM II platform.  
It documents a **fully reproducible application (Case Study 2)** and includes:

- scenario-specific input datasets (S0–S4),
- full computational outputs across all α-cut levels,
- result tables and figures,
- R scripts used for analysis and visualization.

The methodological platform **FES-MADM II** is referenced separately and should be cited via its dedicated DOI.

## Framework version

- **FES-MADM II v1.0.0**: baseline implementation.
- **FES-MADM II v1.0.1**: upgraded version supporting **automatic computation across all α-cut levels**.

All results in this repository are produced using **v1.0.1**.
