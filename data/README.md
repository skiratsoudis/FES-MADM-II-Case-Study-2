# Input data — Case Study 2

This folder contains the **scenario-specific input datasets** used in Case Study 2 of the
FES-MADM II (Fuzzy Entropy–Synergy Multi-Attribute Decision-Making) framework.

## Content
The data correspond to five platform-ready scenarios derived from UK Contracts Finder
open contracting data:

- **S0** — Baseline
- **S1** — Inflation and market tightening
- **S2** — Cyber procurement disruption
- **S3** — Market consolidation
- **S4** — Budget tightening

Each file provides the complete decision matrix required by the FES-MADM II engine.

## Usage
The input files are directly consumed by the FES-MADM II R implementation without
additional preprocessing.

## Notes
- Data are structured consistently across scenarios to ensure comparability.
- The datasets are used exclusively for this case study and serve as inputs for
  reproducible computational analysis.
