# Computational results — Case Study 2

This folder contains the **computational outputs** produced by the FES-MADM II framework
for Case Study 2.

## Content
For each scenario (S0–S4), the folder includes:

- final rankings of alternatives,
- integrated criterion weights,
- audit and discrimination indices,
- robustness and α-cut sensitivity outputs.

In addition, publication-ready figures (tables and plots) generated from the embedded
results are provided.

## Methodological note
All results are generated using **FES-MADM II v1.0.1**, which supports automatic
evaluation across the full α-cut grid.

## Reproducibility
The outputs in this folder correspond exactly to the results reported in the associated
manuscript and can be regenerated using the scripts provided in the `code/` directory.
